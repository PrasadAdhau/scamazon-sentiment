Analyze sentiment in Amazon reviews for **Books** and **Electronics** using **fine-tuned transformer models (BERT & DistilBERT)** and an intuitive **Tkinter GUI**. This project demonstrates the use of **interpretable AI** for real-world sentiment analysis.

---

## 📘 Overview

**Scam-azon** automates review sentiment classification, helping identify patterns and emotional tones across large datasets.  
It compares multiple models, visualizes probabilities, and interprets aspect-level insights (e.g., *battery*, *story*, *durability*).

---

## 🧩 Key Features

✅ Dual-domain Support – Books & Electronics  
✅ Model Comparison – Fine-tuned BERT, DistilBERT, Logistic Regression  
✅ Aspect-Based Sentiment – Detects product-specific opinions  
✅ Tkinter GUI – Clean, responsive desktop interface  
✅ Visualization – Displays probability bars for model confidence

## 📦 Dataset Information

Due to the **large file size (hundreds of MBs)**, the raw datasets are **not uploaded directly to this repository**.  
You can download them from the official **Amazon Customer Reviews (Amazon Product Review Dataset)** hosted on AWS:

| Dataset | Description | Download Link |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Books (v1_02)** | 22M+ book reviews with ratings, verified purchases, and review text | [📥 Download (Books v1_02)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Books_v1_02.tsv.gz) |
| **Electronics (v1_00)** | 7M+ electronics product reviews | [📥 Download (Electronics v1_00)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Electronics_v1_00.tsv.gz) |
| **Full Dataset Index** | Browse all 30+ categories | [Dataset Index](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html) |

After downloading, extract and place both `.tsv` files into your local **`data/`** folder:

### 📊 Sentiment Prediction Example

| Input Review | Predicted Sentiment | Model | Confidence |
|---------------|--------------------|--------|-------------|
| “The story was gripping and beautifully written.” | Positive 😊 | DistilBERT | 0.97 |
| “Battery life is poor and doesn’t last long.” | Negative 😞 | BERT | 0.94 |
| “Average quality, nothing special.” | Neutral 😐 | Logistic Regression | 0.78 |

---


### 🧠 Insights

- **Books:** Emotional tone dominates — most 5★ reviews discuss *story* and *characters*.  
- **Electronics:** Sentiment trends depend heavily on *battery life* and *durability*.  
- **Explainability:** Tokens like *amazing*, *poor*, *disappointed* heavily influence model confidence.
